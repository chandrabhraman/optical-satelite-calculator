# Satellite Optical Sensor Calculator

![flow.gif]

## Overview

A comprehensive tool designed specifically for satellite engineers and mission planners to calculate critical optical sensor parameters. This calculator helps optimize sensor configurations for earth observation satellites, remote sensing platforms, and other orbital imaging systems.

The calculator addresses key challenges in satellite optical system design:
- Computing optimal Ground Sample Distance (GSD) based on orbital parameters
- Determining field of view coverage for different sensor configurations
- Calculating swath width and imaging footprint dimensions 
- Optimizing sensor resolution based on mission altitude and objectives


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ & npm - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chandrabhraman/optical-satelite-calculator.git
